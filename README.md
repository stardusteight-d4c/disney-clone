# Disney Clone | Multiple Requests & NextAuth.js

![banner](banner.png)

> Reconstruction of the Disney Plus interface with carousel and sliders, where data is fetched through `multiple requests` on the server side with `getServerSideProps`, so we have a page generated via `Server Side Rendering`. NextAuth was also used for the user to be able to authenticate and enter the application, in which the account data is sent to Firebase through its adapter for NextAuth. The core of the project was taught on the <strong>ILW Yennefer</strong> channel.
